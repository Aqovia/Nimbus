# Nimbus
Nimbus is a .NET client library to add an easy to develop against experience against the Azure Service Bus brought to you by Damian Maclennan and Andrew Harcourt

This repository is forked from [Nimbus API](https://github.com/NimbusAPI). This forkmaster branch is the default branch, and is still based on [Nimbus V2](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/Nimbus_v2), since version 3 has introduced changes such as at-most-once delivery guarantees, as opposed to at-least-once delivery guarantees (which we require).
This branch contains [changes with pull requests](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/Nimbus/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Ama499), some of which have not yet been merged into Nimbus' master branch.

The master branch in this fork is based on [Nimbus V3](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/Nimbus), and should be kept up-to-date with its upstream master branch. Changes we make in the forkmaster branch should also be made in the master branch, with pull-requests sent to Nimbus - ideally we would like to migrate over to V3 in the future, once it has matured and meets our requirements.
