# Nimbus
Nimbus is a .NET client library to add an easy to develop against experience against the Azure Service Bus brought to you by Damian Maclennan and Andrew Harcourt

This repository is forked from [Nimbus API](https://github.com/NimbusAPI), bringing additional functionality on top of the functionality provided by Nimbus. This forkmaster branch is the default branch, and is still based on [Nimbus V2](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/Nimbus_v2), since version 3 has introduced changes such as at-most-once delivery guarantees, as opposed to at-least-once delivery guarantees.

The master branch is based on [Nimbus V3](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/Nimbus), and should be kept up-to-date with the upstream master branch. Additional functionality we add to the forkmaster branch should also be added to this master branch, with pull-requests sent to Nimbus - ideally we would like to migrate over to V3 in the future, once it has matured.
